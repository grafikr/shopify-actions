# Shopify Actions

A opinionated set of GitHub Actions to automatically create/push/preview themes on Shopify stores.

These actions are built on top of [Theme Kit](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit), and expects a `config.yml` file to exist in your repository.

## Commands

#### Deploy theme(s)

This action will deploy one or more themes using Theme Kit's `deploy` command.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy theme
  uses: grafikr/shopify-actions@v1
  with:
    ACTION: 'DEPLOY'
    COMMAND: "--env='*-production' --allow-live"
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

[Full example](./examples/deploy.yml)

#### Preview theme

This action will create a theme, and add a comment with preview links.

This command will also download any [ignored file](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit/configuration-reference#ignore-patterns]) from the environment specified in the `THEME_KIT_ENVIRONMENT` input.

```yaml
---
- name: Create preview
  uses: grafikr/shopify-actions@v1
  with:
    ACTION: 'PREVIEW'
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

[Full example](./examples/preview.yml)

#### Delete theme

This action will delete a theme which has been created for preview. This is usually an action you want to use when closing a pull request.

```yaml
---
- name: Create preview
  uses: grafikr/shopify-actions@v1
  with:
    ACTION: 'DELETE'
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

[Full example](./examples/delete.yml)
